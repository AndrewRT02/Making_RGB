This program is a color maker program.  To use the program power up the app and you will be met with three seekbars with red, green, and blue labels that also have a color number and a color hex code attached to them.  
You will also see a "Save Color" button and two colors already in the system.  Sliding the seekbars will change the color number and the color hex code.  You will be able to see what color you are making because the
background color will change as you slide the seekbars.  Pushing the "Save Color" button will add your color to the list of colors as well as reset the seekbars and reset the color numbers and color hex code.  Notice how the font changes as you
slide the seekbars and how the font color stays either black or white depending on what color you choose.  To view the color again simply select from the list and the color will ligth up the background again and fill in the textboxes with the
appropriate informations.  

Thanks for enjoying my code.
